<!-- KNOWN ISSUES -->
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### üö´ Problems During Program Startup

Difficulties starting OpenOffice.org (e.g., applications hang) as well as problems with the screen display are often caused by the graphics card driver. If these problems occur, please update your graphics card driver or try using the graphics driver delivered with your operating system. Difficulties displaying 3D objects can often be solved by deactivating the option "Use OpenGL" under 'Tools - Options - OpenOffice.org - View - 3D view'.

### üñ±Ô∏è ALPS/Synaptics Notebook Touchpads in Windows

Due to a Windows driver issue, you cannot scroll through OpenOffice.org documents when you slide your finger across an ALPS/Synaptics touchpad.

To enable touchpad scrolling, add the following lines to the:
- "C:\Program Files\Synaptics\SynTP\SynTPEnh.ini" 
configuration file, and restart your computer:

```
[OpenOffice.org]
FC = "SALFRAME"
SF = 0x10000000
SF |= 0x00004000
```

Note: The location of the configuration file might vary on different versions of Windows.

### üìß Email Issues

The program may crash or freeze when trying to send a document by email using File - Send - Document by Email or Document as PDF attachment. This is due to the Windows MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) system file generating errors with certain file versions.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

You can only use keyboard shortcuts in OpenOffice.org that are not already used by your operating system. If a key combination in OpenOffice.org doesn't work as described in the help, it might already be in use by your system. To resolve such conflicts, you can either change the shortcuts assigned by your operating system or modify most shortcuts in OpenOffice.org.

### üîç Ai Squared ZoomText Compatibility

If you want to use Ai Squared ZoomText with OpenOffice.org 2.4, you need at least version 7.11. Only versions of Ai Squared ZoomText downloaded after June 12, 2002, offer the required functionality.
